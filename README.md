# Kth Element Finder in Two Sorted Arrays
This project contains a Python implementation of an algorithm that finds the k-th smallest element in two sorted sub-arrays using a divide and conquer technique. The goal of this project is to provide an efficient solution for merging two sorted arrays and finding a specific element.

## Problem Description
Given two sorted arrays, the task is to find the k-th smallest element from the merged version of these two arrays. This is done without explicitly merging the two arrays, using a divide and conquer approach to identify the element efficiently.

## How to Run
To run the script, simply execute the following into your terminal: python kth_element.py
The output will display the k-th element for the given input arrays
